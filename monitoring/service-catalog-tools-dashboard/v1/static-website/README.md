# Notes

- The static website is stored in `public_html` folder
- The static website is **auto-generated** by the Angular framework
- **DO NOT MODIFY ANY FILES**. These will be overwritten during the next generation
- Copy all the files from `/static-website/public_html` to the required S3 bucket
- Once copied the `index.html` will be the root file within the S3 static website hosting
- Refer [web-dashboard](../web-dashboard/README.md) for the source code and steps to generate the static website
