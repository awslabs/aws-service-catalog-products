# service-control-policy
This is a solution that provides the ability to create & attach Service Control Policies.

## Description
Service control policies (SCPs) are one type of policy that you can use to manage your organization. SCPs offer central control over the maximum available permissions for all accounts in your organization, allowing you to ensure your accounts stay within your organizationâ€™s access control guidelines.
 
scp-create can be used to create a service control policy. scp-attach will then be used to attach this policy against an Organizational Unit or Account.
