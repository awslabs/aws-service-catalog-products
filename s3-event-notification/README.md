# S3 Event Notifications

This solution creates an event driven approach to process S3 PUT events via SQS and Lambda.

![Template Design](s3-event-notification-design.png)

## Description

* Deploys one product which will listen to any `PUT` events on S3 `files/` prefix folder
* Sends the event to a SQS queue
* Configures a dead-letter queue in case of failures
* Uses KMS encryption on the SQS queues
* Lambda trigger is configured on the SQS queue to extract the `bucketName`, `key` and `eventTime`
